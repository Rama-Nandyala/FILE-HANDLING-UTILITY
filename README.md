##This Java File Handling Utility project is a console-based application designed to demonstrate fundamental file operations such as writing, reading, appending, and modifying the contents of a text file using Java. It interacts with a file named `myfile.txt` and performs these actions sequentially to showcase how Java handles file input and output. The program begins by writing initial content to the file, then reads and displays it line by line. It subsequently appends additional text without overwriting existing content, and finally performs a modification by replacing specific words in the file. Each operation is encapsulated in its own method to promote modularity and code clarity. Proper error handling using `try-catch` blocks ensures the program runs smoothly even if issues like missing files or permission errors occur. This project serves as a foundational exercise for understanding Java's file I/O mechanisms and is suitable for students or developers learning how to work with files in a real-world Java application.
